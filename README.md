# Project-Codes
This repository contains the codes I have done as an undergrad physics student. 
The codes will be uploaded one by one and will be commented on latter on. Most of them are Mathematica codes, but there will be some Matlab ones.
If you intend to use any part of the code, you have to mention that it was originally developed by Abdelrahman B. Attia in a comment in the document and in the report for the code.
